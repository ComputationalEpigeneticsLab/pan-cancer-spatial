## Abstract
Spatial transcriptome reveals valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity within tumor microenvironments (TMEs), paving a way to deeply understand the cellular mechanisms contributing to cancer. Here, we construct a pan-cancer spatial transcriptomic atlas, including 605,663 spots across 229 tissue slices in 19 solid tumors. We delineate five conserved spatial domains and uncover 13 malignant meta-programs that converge into five spatial ecosystems reflecting immune states. Notably, tumor boundary neighborhoods exhibit immunosuppressive features, where cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages co-localize to form tumor immune barrier and impede cytotoxic immune infiltration and sustain tumor stemness. Tumor immune barrier is correlated with immune checkpoint blockade resistance and spatially resolved ligand-receptor interactions implicate CAFâ€“tumor communication in therapy resistance. We propose spatial microenvironment-guided models for identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers in cancer. Overall, we portray a pan-cancer spatial transcriptome atlas and illuminate the spatial heterogeneity of cancer, laying a foundation for identification of biomarkers.
